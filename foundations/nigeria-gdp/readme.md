### Project Overview

In this task, I created a choropleth map visualizing **GDP distribution across Nigerian states**. The map classification was done using a ** quantile-based (equal count) method**.

**Contents:**
This folder contains the materials used to create a **choropleth map of Nigerian states based on GDP (2021)** using QGIS.
* QGIS project file (`.qgz`)
* Exported map layout (PDF)
* CSV file containing 2021 GDP data
* Shapefile data for Nigeria at **Admin 0 (national)** and **Admin 2 (state)** levels
